Calculator App in Kotlin 🚀
I'm thrilled to share the app , and it's all about creating a Calculator App in Kotlin! 📱➕➖✖️➗
This app includes all the essential functions for everyday calculations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I chose Kotlin, the officially announced Android language, to build this handy tool. It was a fantastic opportunity to explore the power of Kotlin in app development. 💡👨‍💻
The journey has been both challenging and incredibly rewarding, and I'm looking forward to tackling the next tasks and continuing to learn and grow. 🌱💪

Here's the app demonstration
